Engineering manager interview behavioral questions


## What was your most successful business outcome? How did you (your team) deliver? How did you enable them?
One of our most successful business outcomes was a cost optimization project where we migrated our CDP pipeline from Segment Twilio to AWS. With an eight-member team, we successfully delivered over 25 use cases within a month, achieving more than 80% in annual cost savings. As the architect and implementation consultant, I worked closely with the team to design a scalable solution, ensuring that we met both technical and business requirements. We established clear milestones, collaborated closely to resolve challenges, and maintained a fast feedback loop for continuous improvements. By fostering a culture of ownership, providing technical guidance, and aligning efforts with business goals, we enabled the team to execute efficiently and deliver impactful results.

## What is your management style? 
Focus on empowering engineers by providing clear direction, removing blockers, and fostering a culture of ownership and accountability. some may need more guidance, while others thrive with autonomy. Regular one-on-ones help me understand their goals & challenges.

## What kind of people will you hire?
 A growth mindset—people with strong communication skills, who take initiative, learn from feedback, and continuously improve.

## Handled a production incident?
Our team has handled multiple production incidents, including one where a change in an internal service affected ad delivery on live events and another where an ad operations configuration change severely impacted ad targeting. The first issue was discovered after some events had gone live, causing minor revenue loss, while the second was identified early, preventing any impact. In both cases, we quickly formed an incident response team via Teams, bringing in relevant stakeholders to assess the impact and implement fixes. Developers worked together to resolve the issue within hours, validating changes in staging before pushing to production after formal UAT by the Ad Operations team. Post-resolution, we conducted an RCA with leadership to identify root causes and implement preventive measures, improving change management, monitoring, and cross-team communication to avoid similar issues in the future.

## Resolved conflicts between team members?
In cases of technical disagreements, I encourage objective decision-making based on data, best practices, and long-term impact. For interpersonal conflicts, I work to find common ground and ensure a respectful, collaborative work environment. My goal is to maintain a healthy team dynamic where everyone feels heard and valued.

## Mentored someone into a higher-level role
I am actively mentoring both junior and senior engineers to help them grow into higher-level roles. My approach includes identifying their strengths and areas for improvement, setting clear development goals, and providing regular feedback through one-on-one sessions and code reviews. I encourage ownership of complex tasks, expose them to architectural decisions, and guide them in improving their leadership and technical skills. 

## Partnered with product management to develop a roadmap/backlog
I have partnered with product management to develop roadmaps and backlogs for multiple projects, including TCF, LiveRamp - ATS, and TheTake AI. As part of these initiatives, I collaborated with external stakeholders to gather and formalize requirements, ensuring alignment with business goals. I played a key role in prioritization, solution design, and planning while also creating user stories, tracking progress, and providing technical guidance. Additionally, I managed cross-functional communication, conducted code reviews, oversaw UAT, and ensured smooth production rollouts, including post-production issue management. My approach ensures a structured and transparent development process, balancing technical feasibility with business needs.

## How did you tackle technical debt?
I tackle technical debt by identifying, prioritizing, and addressing it strategically while balancing business goals. Promote best practices like code-reviews, unit-tests, test environments, design brainstorming to avoid them.

## why do you want to be a EM? 
I want to be an Engineering Manager because I enjoy mentoring engineers, fostering high-performing teams, and driving impactful projects. Throughout my career, I’ve taken on leadership responsibilities—whether through mentoring, leading technical initiatives, or improving team processes. I find fulfillment in creating an environment where engineers can grow while ensuring the team delivers high-quality work aligned with business goals. As an EM, I can have a broader impact by balancing technical execution, people development, and strategic decision-making to help the organization succeed.

## What are the primary responsibilities of an EM?
People management (hiring, retention, grooming, performance management, conflict resolution), Project delivery (planning and execution, technical guidance, code reviews, arechitecture and design) and process strategy (agile+scrum, roadmap prioritization & tech debt)

## How do you set Goals?
Collect inputs from Leadership, Customer feedback & brainstorming with team. Bucket and prioritze them  based on customer satisfaction, tech debt, scalability, data protection etc. 

## What are strech gols vs normal goal?
Size the projects based on them being S, M or L & capacity planning. Anything feature/expectation that falls outside of the timeline is considered a stretch goal. 

## What happens when goals are not met?
Track diligently and anticipate slippage well in-advance to align. Adjust scope or add resource to avoid slippage. Retrospect and identify the root-cause of slippage and apply the learnings in the next project.

## How do you manage performance of your team? 
Measure expectation vs actual deliverables. Frequent checkins (1:1) with focussed discussions with individual or leads.

## How do you help underperformers?
Constructive feedback & empathy through conversations. Identify those that need help and arrange for it by either setting time-bound goals, address competency gaps etc.

## How do you handle topperformers?
 Identify source of motivation - knowledge, money, position, work-life balance etc. and offer them. Allow them to grow within the organisation to gain knowledge breadth.
 
## How will you retain an engineer who wants to leave?
Set up a conversation and understand pain-points, concerns and motivation factors. If it fits within the best interest of the larger team and the company, make an offer. 

## How will you set someone up for a promotion?
Plan ahead and set goals to observe performance. Consistency in achieving the goal will help decide to push them for next role.
Hiring philosophy?
Depending on organizations requirement around skillset & roles, setup an appealing job description selling the work and company. Screen the incoming profiles to identify promising candidates and schedule multiple rounds with senior/leadership to arrive at the hiring decision.
How would you make an offer?
Gauge the candiate’s interest in the role, company by having conversation during the interview process. Discuss compensation and benefits well in-advance prior to making an offer. Allow a reasonable timeline and follow-up with the candidate to confirm offer acceptance. Once accepted, engage at regular interval(s) until the candidate joins the organisation.

## How to communicate layoff?
Schedule 1:1 and be direct, compassionate and clarify details on financial package. Suggest making a good reference/letter of recommendation for the next job.
